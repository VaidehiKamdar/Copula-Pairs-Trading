This project implements a pairs trading strategy using copula functions, combined with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) for stock selection, in a live trading simulator. The strategy begins with a dynamic universe selection, including manual selection of major sector ETFs and tech stocks, as well as automated selection of Dow 30 constituents. Copula functions are then used to model the dependency structure between selected stock pairs, and trading signals are generated based on the predicted convergence or divergence within each pair. Additionally, a CAPM-based model ranks stocks based on their alpha, selecting those with higher than expected returns. The portfolio is equally weighted and rebalanced based on trading signals. The results show that the strategy achieved a cumulative return of 11.12% from January to April 2024, with a Sharpe ratio of 1.36, demonstrating effective risk-adjusted returns.
